# Welcome to the Lumu-test project
Hope you enjoy using the application
I used the [https://www.chartjs.org/](chart.js) library to build the charts
I also used React and Webpack to build the project

# Getting Started with Lumu Test
## Available Scripts
In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`
Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:1999](http://localhost:1999) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `dist` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
